=====================
Prerequisites for AAF
=====================

To *run* AAF, you need the following:
  * Java 8+, openjdk is fine (see Version below)
  * Cassandra
     * a separate installation is fine
     * Docker based AAF Envs offer a single instance Cassandra for convenience.  Single Instance Cassandra is **NOT** recommended for real AAF systems.
  * Machine - one of the following
     * Standalone Java Processes - Bare Metal or VMs.  No additional running environments necessary
     * docker - typically available via packages for O/S
     * kubernetes - various installs available

To *build* AAF, you additionally need:
  * Java 8+, openjdk is fine (see Version below)
  * git
  * maven
  * for Container Based, you'll need Docker to build as well
     * Note: 'minikube' works well to provide both Docker and Kubernetes Single Instance installations.
